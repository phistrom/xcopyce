# xcopyce
**A recursive folder copier for .NET Compact Framework 2.0**

## Usage
`xcopy <source_folder> <destination_folder>`

## Work in Progress
Very early work in progress:
  - Doesn't support any flags whatsoever
  - Will not overwrite destination files
  - Uncontrollably verbose output
  - Bugs? Probably!

This was created to suit my need for a recursive file copy on 
a Windows CE device (to copy files on flash to RAM). It works 
and I'll probably never actually get around to implementing 
all the parameters that the real xcopy has. Sorry if you feel 
cheated. It's an MIT license so go nuts with it.
